## Call Center Data Analysis

# Call Centre Trends Dashboard
I designed a Power BI dashboard to explore different aspects of a call center. This dashboard provides a holistic view of the call center's performance metrics and trends. I curated and showcased key performance indicators (KPIs) that are pivotal in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the call center's operations.

The dashboard showcased the following KPIs:

- Overall Customer Satisfaction: This metric gauges the level of satisfaction among customers who engaged with the call center for assistance.
- The ratio of Calls Answered to Abandoned: By comparing the number of calls answered by agents with those left unanswered by customers, this KPI offered insights into operational efficiency.
- Distribution of Calls Across Time: By analyzing call volume patterns throughout different times of the day, week, or month, trends and peak periods were identified.
- Average Speed of Answer: This KPI quantified the average time agents took to respond to customer calls, indicating responsiveness.
- Agent Performance Quadrant: I plotted agents' performance based on their average handle time (talk duration) and the number of calls answered. This visual insight portrayed agent efficiency and workload distribution.
